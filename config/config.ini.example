# username, password, location and gmaps-key are required



# Important settings

#auth-service: ptc			# ptc (default) or google
#username:
#password:

#accountcsv:				# Load accounts from a CSV file containing "auth-service,username,password" lines.
gmaps-key:					# your Google Maps API key
hash-key: []				# Needed to scan. For multiple [xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]



# Database settings

db-type: mysql				# sqlite (default) or mysql
db-host:					# required for mysql
db-name:					# required for mysql
db-user:					# required for mysql
db-pass:					# required for mysql
#db-port:					# default 3306
#db-max_connections:		# default 5; due to the nature of automated worker assignment, unless you're specifically defining workers, this will always be equal to the number of accounts available.
#db-threads:				# default 1



# Search settings

location: 
speed_limit:				# max speed limit in km/hr, varies randomly between 70-100%. Overrides scan-delay
step-limit:					# default 12
jitter
#login-delay:				# default 6; How long we wait between starting up individual threads.
#scan-delay:				# default 10; used for the scan-retry delay, otherwise overridden by the speed limiter
#spawn_delay: 15			# default 10; how long we wait after a spawnpoint produces a pokemon, in seconds
#scan_retries: 1			# Scan attempts *after* the initial scan
#max-failures: 1			# Maximum number of failed scans before retiring the account.
#account-rest-interval:		# Seconds for accounts to rest when they fail or are switched out. (default=7200)
#account-search-interval:	# Seconds for accounts to search before switching to a new account. (default=0)
#spawns_per_worker:			# how many spawnpoints a single worker can handle. This is typically constant no matter where you scan. If a hex exceeds this, it spawns another worker.
#workers_per_hive:			# how many workers per hex area. If spawns_per_worker is enabled, map will spawn at LEAST this many workers per hive



# Extra search settings

#no-gyms					# disables gym scanning (default false)
#no-pokemon					# disables pokemon scanning (default false); increases "worker jump" distance to 450m. Recommend to increase speed limit to ~120 since these don't disappear with speed.
#no-pokestop				# disables pokestop scanning (default false)

#skip-empty					# Standard hexagon pattern creation, skipping areas with no scannable areas in them. Also no longer creates threads or assigns workers to empty spots when used with beehive
#usestops					# Use with skip-empty to standard hex-scan areas within 900m of a fort (stop/gym). Handy for scanning large areas
#spawnpoint-scanning		# Direct spawnpoint scanning. Also no longer creates threads or assigns workers to empty spots when used with beehive
#sscluster					# Spawnpoint clustering. Defaulted to 4 minutes (240 seconds) and 70m radius (only active when spawnpoint-scanning active)
#cluster-time				# Default 240; Spawnpoint scan will wait up to this value (in seconds) + spawn_delay to get maxmimum pokemon in a single scan. 4 minutes typically reduces scanned locations by ~30%
#beehive
#by_hex_count:				# Minimum number of hex locations to create for scanning. Be advised: WILL finish creating the current ring, so if you set it between 2 and 6, it will create 7 (to finish the ring)
#leaps:						# Number of complete beehive 'rings' to create. Rings:Hexes = 1:1, 2:7, 3:19, 4:37, 5:61, 6:91, 7:127...
#by_valid_count:			# Number of hexagons that have scannable locations (forts, spawns) within their boundaries. Will continue to grow until this number is satisfied, useful if you have limited workers but sparse areas.

#ignore-list: []			# list of Pokemon IDs to ignore parsing (default []); In layman's terms: these pokemon never see the database; they ARE still scanned and ARE still processed for spawnpoint information though!
#gym-info:					# enables detailed gym info collection (default false)
#min-seconds-left:			# time (in seconds) that must be left on a spawn before considering it too late and skipping it (default 0)
#step_distance:				# inoperative currently



# Pokemon IV 

#encounter
#encounter-delay: 5
#encounter-whitelist: []
#encounter-blacklist: []	# blacklist of pokemon ids to NOT encounter. Syntax [id,id,id,id] (Do not use with whitelist)



# Misc

#captcha-solving
#captcha-key: 
#status-name:				# enables writing status updates to the database - if you use multiple processes, each needs a unique value
#print-status				# Enable ENTER to switch between log view and a status view.
#status-page-password:		# enables and protects the /status page to view status of all workers
#disable-clean				# Stops cleaning the db from old scanned locations, workers that might be in use (gets cleared after 15 mins), runs the purge database stuff, etc. (its a good idea to keep only one process running it)
#purge-data:				# Purge database after X hours



# Proxy settings

#proxy: []					# Proxy URL e.g. xxxxxx://127.0.0.1:9050 or a list of proxies e.g. [xxxxxx://127.0.0.1:9050,xxxxxx://127.0.0.1:9050]
#dead-proxies: []
#proxy-timeout:				# Timeout before proceeding with next proxy while checking if the proxy works, (default 5)
#proxy-display:				# Used with -ps, full = display complete proxy address. Index = displays just the index for that proxy (default index)



# Webhook settings

#webhook:					# webhook URL (including http://)
#webhook-updates-only  		# only send updates to webhooks, (excludes gyms & non-lured pok√©stops)
#wh-threads:				# Number of webhook threads; increase if the webhook queue falls behind. (default=1)



# Webserver settings
